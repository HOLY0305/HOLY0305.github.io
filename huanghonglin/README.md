This is a React application built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## How to run locally

Since this project uses React and TypeScript (.tsx files), it cannot be run by simply opening `index.html` in a browser. You need to use a development server to compile the code.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 16 or higher)

### Installation & Run

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in this folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and visit the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Editing Content

- **Personal Info & Projects**: Edit `data/content.ts`
- **Images/PDFs**: Place your files in the `public/assets` folder and update the paths in `data/content.ts`.
